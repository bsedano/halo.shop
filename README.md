# Run the yarn or npm command on the terminal with the project folder open, then yarn or npm will download all dependencies

# After installing all needed dependencies, run yarn start and wait a moment, then the application will open on your default browser.

# If you want to run the application on a different port, you can use the --port flag.

# The application was made using ReactJS, Redux with Redux Thunks for managing global states and ChakraUI for styling and component creation.

# The application is a little heavy, because of the size of the images, unfortunately I didn't find links with the images I wanted and I had to download and edit them, in the future I intend to make an api with all the "products", leaving the application lighter.

# I hope you enjoy the application as much as I enjoyed developing it!

# Link to the application: https://burger-shop-bsedano.vercel.app/
